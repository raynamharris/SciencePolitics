## TITLE I — MAXIMIZING BASIC RESEARCH - Highlights, Summaries, and Notes

### SEC. 101. REAFFIRMATION OF MERIT-BASED PEER REVIEW.
Congress thinks that Federal funding of basic research is essential to US leadership in science and technology. **NSF's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria are appropriate and should be maintained**, as concluded by the 2011 National Science Board Task Force on Merit Review. If after the date of enactment of this Act a change is made to the merit-review process, the Director shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress not later than 30 days after the date of the change.

### SEC. 102. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
NSF has found that additional transparency into individual grants is valuable in communicating and assuring the public value of federally funded research. NSF should commit to transparency and accountability and to clear, consistent public communication regarding the national interest for each Foundation-awarded grant and cooperative agreement. The NSF director shall **update guidance policy** for staff and other merit review process participants on the importance of transparency and accountability to the outcomes made through the merit review process. 

All public notices must:
- describe how the project reflects the NSF mission 
- describe how the project addresses the NSF's intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria
- clearly identifying the research goals of the project in a manner that can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

The NSF shall apply a broader impacts review criterion to identify and demonstrate project support of the following goals:

1. Increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States.
2. Advancing of the health and welfare of the American public.
3. Supporting the national defense of the United States.
4. Enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States.
5. Developing an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive through improved pre-kindergarten through grade 12 STEM education and teacher development, and improved undergraduate STEM education and instruction.
6. Improving public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the United States.
7. Expanding participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.

**Rayna's Side note: As far as I can tell, the current broader impact criterion were set back in 2007 in [this dear colleague letter](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07046/nsf07046.jsp). They are**

1. Advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.
2. Broaden participation of under-represented groups.
3. Enhance infrastructure for research and education.
4. Broaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding.
5. Benefits to society.

### SEC. 103. EPSCOR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) REAFFIRMATION AND UPDATE.
Rayna's comments: This section reads like a transcript of a tracked changes word file. But, I think that main thing is that the name will be changed from "Experimental" to "Established" and that all the changes were made to reflect updates about the success of the program.

### SEC. 104. CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH.
Ammendements adds wording "perform research to support the development of voluntary, consensus-based, industry-led standards and recommendations on the security of computers, computer networks, and computer data storage used in election systems to ensure voters can vote securely and privately.” to an existing act [15 U.S.C. 272(c)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:15%20section:272%20edition:prelim)

### SEC. 105. NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UPDATE.
The will amend the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5501), striking “high-performance computing” and inserting “networking and information technology, including high-performance computing.

### SEC. 106. PHYSICAL SCIENCES COORDINATION.
The Physical Science Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council shall continue to coordinate Federal efforts related to high-energy physics research to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of United States investment in high-energy physics.

### SEC. 107. LABORATORY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS.
The Director of NIST, acting through the Associate Director for Laboratory Programs, shall develop and implement a comprehensive strategic plan for laboratory programs that expands interactions with academia, international researchers, and industry; and commercial and industrial applications. The strategic plan will include performance metrics, documentation, clarified approaches, and consider recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences.

### SEC. 108. STANDARD REFERENCE DATA ACT UPDATE.
Defines the term standard reference data as either 
- quantitative information related to a measurable physical, or chemical, or biological property 
- measurable characteristics of a physical artifact or artifacts
- engineering properties or performance characteristics of a system
- 1 or more digital data objects that serve to calibrate or characterize the performance of a detection or measurement system; or to interpolate or extrapolate, or both

### SEC. 109. NSF MID-SCALE PROJECT INVESTMENTS.
NSF funds major research facilities, infrastructure, and instrumentation that provide unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and engineering. Modern and effective research facilities, infrastructure, and instrumentation are critical to maintaining United States leadership in science and engineering. The costs of some proposed research instrumentation, equipment, and upgrades to major research facilities fall between programs currently funded by the Foundation, creating a gap between the established parameters of the Major Research Instrumentation and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction programs, including projects that have been identified as cost-effective additions of high priority to the advancement of scientific understanding.

NSF shall evaluate the existing and future needs, across all disciplines supported by NSF, for mid-scale projects. In this subsection, **the term mid-scale projects means** research instrumentation, equipment, and upgrades to major research facilities or other research infrastructure investments that exceed the maximum award funded by the major research instrumentation program


### SEC. 110. OVERSIGHT OF NSF MAJOR MULTI-USER RESEARCH FACILITY PROJECTS.
