## TITLE I — MAXIMIZING BASIC RESEARCH - Highlights, Summaries, and Notes

### SEC. 101. REAFFIRMATION OF MERIT-BASED PEER REVIEW.
Congress thinks that Federal funding of basic research is essential to US leadership in science and technology. **NSF's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria are appropriate and should be maintained**, as concluded by the 2011 National Science Board Task Force on Merit Review. If after the date of enactment of this Act a change is made to the merit-review process, the Director shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress not later than 30 days after the date of the change.

### SEC. 102. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
NSF has found that additional transparency into individual grants is valuable in communicating and assuring the public value of federally funded research. NSF should commit to transparency and accountability and to clear, consistent public communication regarding the national interest for each Foundation-awarded grant and cooperative agreement. The NSF director shall **update guidance policy** for staff and other merit review process participants on the importance of transparency and accountability to the outcomes made through the merit review process. 

All public notices must:
- describe how the project reflects the NSF mission 
- describe how the project addresses the NSF's intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria
- clearly identifying the research goals of the project in a manner that can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

The NSF shall apply a broader impacts review criterion to identify and demonstrate project support of the following goals:
1. Increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States.
2. Advancing of the health and welfare of the American public.
3. Supporting the national defense of the United States.
4. Enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States.
5. Developing an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive through improved pre-kindergarten through grade 12 STEM education and teacher development, and improved undergraduate STEM education and instruction.
6. Improving public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the United States.
7. Expanding participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.

**Rayna's Side note: As far as I can tell, the current broader impact criterion were set back in 2007 in [this dear colleague letter](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07046/nsf07046.jsp). They are**
1. Advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning, for example, by training graduate students, mentoring postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty,  involving undergraduates in research experiences, and participating in the recruitment, training, and professional development of K-12 mathematics and science teachers.
2. Broaden participation of under-represented groups, for example,by establishing collaborations with students and faculty from institutions and organizations serving women, minorities, and other groups under-represented in the mathematical sciences.
3. Enhance infrastructure for research and education, for example, byestablishing collaborations with researchers in industry and government laboratories, developing partnerships with international academic institutions and organizations, and building networks of U.S. colleges and universities.
4. Broaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding, for example, bypresenting results of research and education projects in formats useful to students, scientists and engineers, members of Congress, teachers, and the general public.
5. Benefits to society mayoccur, for example, when results of research and education projects are applied to other fields of science and technology to create startup companies, to improve commercial technology, to inform public policy, and to enhance national security.

### SEC. 103. EPSCOR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) REAFFIRMATION AND UPDATE.
Rayna's comments: This section reads like a transcript of a tracked changes word file. But, I think that main thing is that the name will be changed from "Experimental" to "Established" and that all the changes were made to reflect updates about the success of the program.

### SEC. 104. CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH.
Ammendements adds wording "perform research to support the development of voluntary, consensus-based, industry-led standards and recommendations on the security of computers, computer networks, and computer data storage used in election systems to ensure voters can vote securely and privately.” to an existing act [15 U.S.C. 272(c)](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:15%20section:272%20edition:prelim)
